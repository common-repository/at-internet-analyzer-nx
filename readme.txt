AnalyzerNx allows the automatic tagging of pages generated by WordPress.

== Description ==

AT Internet uses the tagging method. The tag, which is a few lines JavaScript code, must be placed on each page you want to audit.
This tagging allows to integrate the tags on a different server than the one which hosts your site.

= Composition of the tag generated by AnalyzerNx : =

* a variable for the level in the tree structure (xtnv = document; by default).
* a variable for the data collection server (xtsd).
* a variable for the site number (xtsite).
* a variable for the level 2 (xtn2 = ""; by default).   
* a variable for the page name (xtpage).
* a variable for the degree of importance (xtdi = ""; by default). 
* optional: an additional line which allows to activate the ClickZone® functionality on your site. 

= Automatic naming of pages : =

* Posts blogs.
> If a post blog belongs to a category: *xtpage="posts_blogs::category-name::blog-post-name"*.
>
> Or else: *xtpage="posts\_blogs::blog-post-name"*.

* Static pages.
> *xtpage="static\_page::page\_name"*.

* Homepage.
> *xtpage="homepage::homepage"*.
